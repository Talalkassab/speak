## Daily Progress Log

### August 12, 2025 - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PHASE
**Phase**: Implementation Testing & Dependency Resolution  
**Active Agent**: `playwright-mcp-testing`  
**Focus**: Full Platform Functionality Assessment

#### Today's Goals - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] Test authentication flow with Arabic RTL support
- [x] Test signup/login functionality 
- [x] Test API endpoint security and responses
- [x] Test dashboard navigation and routing
- [x] Identify missing dependencies blocking features
- [x] Document complete functionality status

#### Comprehensive Testing Results

**✅ WORKING FEATURES (40% Functional)**
- Perfect Arabic RTL authentication: "تسجيل الدخول إلى منصة الاستشارات الذكية"
- Signup flow with organization creation: "انضم إلى منصة الاستشارات الذكية للموارد البشرية"
- OAuth integrations (Google, GitHub, Email) configured
- API authentication middleware (proper 401 responses)
- Supabase database integration active
- Navigation and routing functional
- Security middleware working

**❌ BLOCKED FEATURES (60% Non-Functional)**
- Analytics dashboard completely blocked (missing `date-fns`, `recharts`)
- Chat interface fails to load (missing `recordrtc`)
- Voice recording features unavailable
- Document templates UI not accessible
- Export functionality blocked
- Real-time analytics broken

#### Critical Blockers Identified
1. **Missing Dependencies**: `date-fns`, `recharts`, `recordrtc`
2. **Import Export Errors**: `createServerClient`, `getUserSession` missing
3. **Content Issues**: Homepage shows placeholder "Generate banners with DALL·E"

#### Immediate Actions Required
```bash
npm install date-fns recharts recordrtc --legacy-peer-deps
```

#### Blockers
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Missing npm dependencies prevent 60% of features
- 🟡 **Important**: Import/export resolution needed for server clients
- 🟡 **Important**: Homepage content needs HR platform update
